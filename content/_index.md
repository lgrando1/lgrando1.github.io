      text: |-
        I am a **Ph.D. in Technology** from UNICAMP and a Researcher dedicated to exploring the boundaries of **Complex Systems**, **Artificial Intelligence**, and **Agent-Based Simulation (NetLogo)**. My work focuses on applying quantitative methods to solve real-world problems in **IoT (Internet of Things)** and engineering.

        With a strong background in industry (Hyundai) and academia, I currently serve as a Professor at **UNASP** and **UNISAL**, shaping the next generation of tech professionals in Computer Engineering and System Information.

        I am always open to discussing **Data Science**, **Python automation**, and innovative educational projects.
