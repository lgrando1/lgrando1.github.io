abstract: The use of computational tools for the simulation of physical phenomena is increasing, saving time and money in new processes and materials development. This study aims to use the Java tool for developing a program to compute the kinetics of sintering of vitreous material for ceramics manufacturing. Through this process, special glasses are grinded, compacted and sintered, with simultaneous or subsequent particles crystallization. A recent solution for the sintering process of glass by viscous flow, called Cluster Model, considers the effect of surface crystallization of the particles, which limits the densification (pore elimination) of the material, and allows to deal with mixtures of particles of different sizes. We developed a program in JAVA based on the Clusters Model, for calculations of the sintering kinetics of compact particles of glass powder with different particle sizes and concurrent crystallization. Published data for glasses in the systems Al2O3-B2O3-SiO2 and CaO-MgO-SiO2 were used to check the results of the program, expressed as graphs, which repeated with great precision the literature values.
