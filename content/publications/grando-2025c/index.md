abstract: The low battery autonomy of Unnamed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs or drones) can make smart farming (precision agriculture), disaster recovery, and the fighting against dengue vector applications difficult. This article considers two approaches, first enumerating the characteristics observed in these three IoT application types and then modeling an UAV's battery recharge coordination using the Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) approach. In this way, we propose that each drone inside the swarm does not communicate concerning this recharge coordination decision, reducing energy usage and permitting remote usage. A total of 6000 simulations were run to evaluate how two proposed policies, the BaseLine (BL) and ChargerThershold (CT) coordination recharging policy, behave in 30 situations regarding how each simulation sets conclude the simulation runs and how much time they work until recharging results. CT policy shows more reliable results in extreme system usage. This work conclusion presents the potential of these three IoT applications to achieve their perpetual service without communication between drones and ground stations. This work can be a baseline for future policies and simulation parameter enhancements.

summary: Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) model for UAV battery recharge coordination in Precision Agriculture, Disaster Recovery, and Dengue control, proposing policies to reduce communication overhead.
