abstract: This paper presents an agent-based simulation model for coordinating battery recharging in drone swarms, focusing on applications in Internet of Things (IoT) and Industry 4.0 environments. The proposed model includes a detailed description of the simulation methodology, system architecture, and implementation. One practical use case is explored; Smart Farming, highlighting how autonomous coordination strategies can optimize battery usage and mission efficiency in large-scale drone deployments. This work uses a machine learning technique to analyze the agent-based simulation sensitivity analysis output results.
