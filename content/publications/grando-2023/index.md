abstract: The Connected Farm is composed of several elements that communicate with each other through a 4G/5G Radio Base Station (RBS) placed in the middle of the farm. This RBS is connected to the Internet, allowing communication for all kinds of autonomous devices, performing uninterrupted tasks. This work simulates the Connected Farm environment for an autonomous drone. Our model intends to define when each drone needs to recharge its batteries, with no collusion regarding this recharging decision, reducing the drone’s battery usage due to the absence of this communication.
