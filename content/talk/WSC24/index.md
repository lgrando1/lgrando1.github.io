abstract: "The applications of Unnamed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or Drones have been increasing in areas such as Smart Farming, Disaster Recovery, and combat of tropical mosquito diseases such as Dengue. Due to the short duration of the electrical battery capacity, at most 20 to 30 minutes in some cases, most UAVs have low battery capacity to carry out missions. This work presents two contributions: i) a description of the characteristics observed in three drone applications (agricultural, disaster, and against dengue disease), and ii) the creation of an Agent-Based Simulation Model considering energy supply simulation. This model considers that the agents will not collude about their recharging decisions."
