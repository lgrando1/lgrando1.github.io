summary: "Presentation of the paper on network planning, dimensioning, and QoS requirements using discrete event simulation."
abstract: "This paper presents a general framework for planning and dimensioning a multi-service Internet Protocol (IP) network supporting voice, video, and data. We describe a methodology for dimensioning link capacity and packet delay while meeting Quality of Service (QoS) requirements under general traffic distributions, using discrete event simulation. Additionally, the paper proposes a procedure to optimize transmission probabilities between nodes, aiming to increase throughput and reduce delay based on the offered network traffic. This procedure applies different transmission probabilities for each node type. Admission control is implicitly incorporated to regulate the number of active streams. A Jackson network is employed to validate the simulation model. Once validated, other probability distributions are explored to assess achievable delay and throughput, and the resulting suboptimal optimization outcomes are presented."
