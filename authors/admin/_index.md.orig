title: Leonardo Grando

Leonardo Grando is a Ph.D. Student at the University of Campinas (UNICAMP) in Brazil. I am interested in complex systems, agent-based simulation, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, programming, and machine learning tools.
I have expertise in Netlogo, Python, R, Latex, SQL, and Linux tools.

My Ph.D. work project is an IoT devices (UAVs) swarm agent-based modeling simulation (ABMS) aiming the perpetual flight. The workflow is **Netlogo** to ABMS simulate, **Python** and **R** to data analysis, and I use **Latex** for my thesis writing.

I started my career change from the automotive industry as a productivity improvement professional to the academic and data science field in 2019. After this career change, I worked as a teacher in fundamental and high school and as a teaching intern at the undergraduate level.
